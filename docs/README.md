Still WIP. TBD

## About
- [x] v3 is a minimal C framework to help you build custom, scalable game engines and creative apps.
- [x] v3 is modular at its core, allowing you to toggle or replace its APIs at runtime.
- [x] v3 is community-driven, enabling developers to create and share extensions without requiring approval.
- [x] v3 is a major overhaul of the previous [v2](https://github.com/r-lyeh/v2) and [v1](https://github.com/r-lyeh/v1) iterations, being lighter and more flexible than them.
- [x] v3 is released into the [**public domain**](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/) or, at your discretion, licensed under the [0-BSD](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/0bsd/), [0MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit-0/), or [uL](https://github.com/r-lyeh/uLicense).
- [x] v3 is minimalist by design. Key benefits include: <!-- v3 is a minimal C framework that lets you integrate your preferred tools and libraries via optional extensions  V3‚àµ: -->
- [x] <!--**Customizable & Scalable**:-->Build only what you need, without unnecessary features.
- [x] <!--**Lightweight & Portable**:-->Small footprint that fits on low-end hardware and boosts development cycles.
- [x] <!--**Freedom of Choice**:-->Select libraries that match your preferred syntax or performance needs, avoiding rigid or unfamiliar APIs.
- [x] <!--**Community-Fueled**:-->The bring-your-own-tech approach encourages communities to experiment with v3 in new directions.

## Features and roadmap ·ïï(·êõ)·ïó
- [x] ~~Modern C++~~ Simple C.
- [x] ~~Royaltie fee~~ Free.
- [x] ~~Licensing clauses~~ Nope.
- [x] ~~Full featured~~ Extendable.
- [x] ~~Rich build system~~ `gcc v3.c`
- [x] Ecosystem: Community-fueled by design, via decentralized extensions.
- [x] Modular: Module APIs can be toggled, replaced or switched at runtime.
- [x] Compilers: vs2022, gcc6, clang, clang-cl, mingw.
- [x] Desktops: Windows, Linux, OSX. ~~Emscripten (untested).~~

## Preinstalled extensions
- [x] App: window, icon, cursors, alerts.
- [x] Archives: DIR, ZIP.
- [x] Audio: 2D, 3D, OGG, WAV.
- [x] Compression: Deflate.
- [x] Devices: Battery, Keyboard, Mouse, Gamepads.
- [x] Documents: INI, XML, JSON, JSON5, SJSON.
- [x] DS: Arrays, HashMaps and Sets.
- [x] Embed: resource files embedded automatically.
- [x] Images: WEBP, PNG, JPG, TGA, BMP, PSD, GIF...
- [x] Logger, callstacks, memory leaks finder, unit-tests.
- [x] OpenGL: GL2, GL3, GL4.
- [x] Scripts: Lua. <!-- move to an ext? -->
- [x] Time, threads, ~~timers, and coroutines (planned)~~ utilities.
- [x] UI: buttons, sliders, checkbox, colors, popups.

## Quickstart
- Double-click `v3.sh`. Launch `v3.exe` when done.
- Other commands,
    - `v3.sh tidy` to clean environment.
    - `v3.sh sync` to sync repo to latest.
    - `v3.sh ext`  to un/install extensions.

## Manual builds
- Alternatively, you can compile v3 manually as follows:
```bash
echo win/vc       && cl v3.c                  
echo win/clang    && clang v3.c                
echo win/clang-cl && clang-cl v3.c             
echo win/mingw    && gcc v3.c -lgdi32 -ldbghelp -lole32 -lwininet
echo linux        && cc v3.c -lm -ldl -lpthread -lasound
echo osx          && SDKROOT=macosx10.14 cc -ObjC v3.c -framework cocoa -framework iokit -framework audiotoolbox
```

## Un/installing extensions
- Currently, [all these extensionsüíú are hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/ext-v3?s=updated).
- It is planned that the v3 launcher will be used to un/install extensions in the future.
- For now, you can un/install extensions via `v3 ext` script:
  - `v3 ext dir`
  - `v3 ext [add|del|syn] *`
  - `v3 ext [add|del|syn] user/repo`
  - `v3 ext [add|del|syn] @filelist.txt`

## Publishing and Sharing your extensions. <!-- [vfs] [mojoal] [physics(tokamak), ddraw] [scene, object, culling, pvs] [spine, spritesheets, tiles], [compression, encryption,] [pathfinding, boids, goap, behavior trees] [profiler, stats] [font, lockit]  [media: ffmpeg,assimp,pvrtoolcli,cuttlefish ... ase,tmx,fur,mid,mod,sfxr] [cloud services: steam/steamworks] [context hints: OpenGL, ~~Vulkan, MSAA, Debug~~] --><!-- logo: V¬∑3 or ‚àµ -->
TBD

## Tips
- DLL build: Compile `cl v3.c /LD` then `cl game.c v3.lib`
- Retail build: Compile with `-DNDEBUG=2 -O2` flags. Add `/MT` flag in Windows.

<!--
$ gcc -shared -fPIC v3.c -o v3.so   # `-shared` to generate a dll, `-fPIC` required
$ gcc -rdynamic -ldl game.c -o game # `-rdynamic` same than exporting everything by default (V3_API=V3_EXPORT)

- Run `echo #include "v3.h" > v3unity.c && cc/cl/clang/clang-cl v3unity.c -I. -E > v3unity.h` to generate an amalgamated single-file header that *will work __only__* under the specific dev environment that generated it. I.e, once generated, using different libc/winSDK versions, switching operating systems, or switching to a different compiler, or downgrading/upgrading the compiler version will likely generate compile errors.

clang requires this in order to compile v3unity.h artifact
